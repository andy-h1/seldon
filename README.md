[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/abf89fd7-9877-412e-a660-e198df28e051/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/seldon/deploys)

Common Scripts:

- yarn install dependencies
- yarn start run the project locally
- yarn test run the test suite
- yarn lint to lint the project
- yarn storybook run Storybook to see the component library

Developer Notes:

If given more time I would look to make this dashboard mobile responsive. In mobile the side panel would be turned into a burger menu, the cards would turn into a carousel and the rest of the components would be stacked into a column.

I didn't implement React Context in this task as there wasn't much prop drilling in my app. However please find this link for a previous project where I implemented Context API to demonstrate my knowledge: https://github.com/andy-h1/Idea-Board/blob/master/src/contexts/IdeaContext/index.js
