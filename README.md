Common Scripts:

- yarn install dependencies
- yarn start run the project locally
- yarn test run the test suite
- yarn lint to lint the project
- yarn storybook run Storybook to see the component library

Developer Notes:

If given more time I would look to make this dashboard mobile responsive. In mobile the side panel would be turned into a burger menu, the cards would turn into a carousel and the rest of the components would be stacked into a column.
